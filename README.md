# Web-Dev-Journey
My web dev journey from basic to advanced.

I am currently learning and working on the JS part. Forgot to keep HTML and CSS in the same folder. Actually I wrote most of the code in my notebook. ☠️
But no need to worry. I will revise them very soon(after completing MERN and JS) and add the code. 🙂
